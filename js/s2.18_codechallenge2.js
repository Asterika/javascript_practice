/*****************************
* CODING CHALLENGE 2
*/

// John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.
//
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team
// 2. Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console. Also include the average score in the output.
// 3. Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw (the same average score)
//
// 4. EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average winner to the console. HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision. If you can't solve this one, just watch the solution, it's no problem :)
// 5. Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.
//
// GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€


// calculate the average for each team
// write a general function for finding the average

//1. Calculate the average for each team:
let johnTeamAverage = (89 + 120 + 103) / 3;
let mikeTeamAverage = (116 + 94 + 123) / 3;
let maryTeamAverage = (97 + 134 + 105) / 3;
  console.log(johnTeamAverage, mikeTeamAverage, maryTeamAverage);

//2. Compare the teams' averages
// if (johnTeamAverage > mikeTeamAverage) {
//   console.log('John\'s team wins with an average of ' + johnTeamAverage + ' points!');
// } else if (mikeTeamAverage > johnTeamAverage) {
//   console.log('Mike\'s team wins with an average of ' + mikeTeamAverage + ' points!');
// } else {
//   console.log('The two teams tied for highest average!');
// }

//3. Add Mary into the mix:
if (johnTeamAverage > mikeTeamAverage && johnTeamAverage > maryTeamAverage) {
  console.log('John\'s team wins with an average of ' + johnTeamAverage + ' points!');
} else if (mikeTeamAverage > johnTeamAverage && mikeTeamAverage > maryTeamAverage) {
  console.log('Mike\'s team wins with an average of ' + mikeTeamAverage + ' points!');
} else if (maryTeamAverage > johnTeamAverage && maryTeamAverage > mikeTeamAverage) {
  console.log('Mary\'s team wins with an average of ' + maryTeamAverage + ' points!');
} else {
  console.log('There is a spontaneous tie!');
}
